# HotCiv
HotCiv is a simple Civilization-style game that is used to demonstrate various software design patterns and principles using TDD.
# Motivation
* What are the steps in a typical software development process?
* What is software evolution and quality?
* How do you write maintainable software?
* How are these activities organized in a company or typical programming journey?
# Principles and Tools 
* Followed three main standards from ISO 25010:
    * Maintainability (ISO 9126): Capability of software to be modifiable
    * Reliability (ISO 9126): Maintain a specified level of performance
    * Changeability (ISO 9126): Change by addition and not modification
* Major Release Branching model was used for the entire project
* Code Quality was determined by SOLID principles
* Extreme Programming (XP): Strictly followed automated testing practices using the Test-driven development(TDD) process.
* Git: Utilized Git version control for the software development process
* IntelliJ: JUnit tool used for unit testing
# Results and Design Patterns 
* Code Coverage: 93%
* Design Patterns Utilised:
  * Compositional Design
  * STRATEGY Design
  * Abstract Factory
  * Decorator
* Testing methods:
  * Systematic testing
  * Unit-testing
* MiniDraw framework integrated and utilized by project
