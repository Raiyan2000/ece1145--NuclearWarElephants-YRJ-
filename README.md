# HotCiv: Demonstrating Software Design Patterns and Principles with Test-Driven Development (TDD)
HotCiv is a Civilization-style game designed to showcase various software design patterns and principles using Test-Driven Development (TDD). This project aims to provide insights into software development processes, software evolution, and maintaining high software quality standards.
# ðŸš€ Motivation
HotCiv was developed to address key questions in software development, such as:

* What are the steps in a typical software development process?
* How does software evolution impact product quality?
* What practices contribute to writing maintainable software?
* How are these activities organized in a company or typical programming journey?
# ðŸ’¡ Principles and Tools 
* Followed three main standards from ISO 25010:
    * <strong>Maintainability (ISO 9126):</strong> Capability of software to be modifiable
    * <strong>Reliability (ISO 9126):</strong> Maintain a specified level of performance
    * <strong>Changeability (ISO 9126):</strong> Change by addition and not modification
* <strong>SOLID Principles:</strong> Ensuring code quality and extensibility.
* <strong>Extreme Programming (XP):</strong> Following TDD to maintain high test coverage and code quality.
* <strong>Git Version Control:</strong> Leveraging Git for efficient collaboration and version management.
* <strong>IntelliJ and JUnit:</strong> Utilizing industry-standard tools for development and testing.
# ðŸŒŸ Results and Design Patterns 
* <strong>Code Coverage:</strong> Achieving a commendable 93% code coverage.
* <strong>Design Patterns Utilized:</strong> Including Compositional Design, STRATEGY Design, Abstract Factory, and Decorator.
* <strong>Testing Methods:</strong> Employing systematic and unit testing to ensure robustness.
* <strong>Integration with MiniDraw Framework:</strong> Demonstrating integration skills with external frameworks.
